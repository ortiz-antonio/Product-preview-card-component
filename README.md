# CUBE CSS Eleventy Taskfile Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for **me**, based on [Cube Boilerplate](https://github.com/Set-Creative-Studio/cube-boilerplate)
Thank you!

## Getting started

After running `task setup` run `task install` then `task dev`. This will serve up a local version of the HTML page and watch for CSS changes.
